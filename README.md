# Muon Source
This project is to simulate and provide a documented guide for generating muons (and other 
particles, such as pions) cheaply for the purpose of science experiments. One potential usecase
in this is for Muon Catalyzed Cold Fusion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon-catalyzed_fusion
on a budget.  

This code is created with Geant4 which is a monte carlo particle simulator from CERN. MARS15 would also work but I couldn't obtain the software yet.

## Building
How to build the project.

## Running

## Physical Creation
How to construct the actual experiment physically (TODO after simulations reach a stable point).

### Inspiration
Inspired and initially based on [Low-Budget Muon Source](low_budget_muon_source.pdf) by Belbekov and Mokhov.
